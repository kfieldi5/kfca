        "Joined the team after hearing about it at CES 2024. I love the synths Teenage Engineering makes and the fact that they were involved in the hardware design for this pocket AI device made me very interested. We are still pumping out feature after feature with 50 balls in the air but the device has taken massive strides. We are now experimenting with Generative UI, as well as different avenues for AI personal assistant agents.",

        "I had the pleasure of working on this beast of an app on and off for 6 years and helped transition it to its latest form: a Flutter iOS/Android app. For the time being, I think the company is keeping the web experience in JS. The mobile app has had 3 different types of game engines embedded, three major redesign overhauls and loads of features over the nearly 2 decades it's been around. Working closely with the neuroscience team and understanding the 'why' behind the games was definitely a big highlight.",

        "This was the Lumos Labs venture into the meditation app market and we learned a ton from it. Product lessons aside, the engineering core created its first cross platform UI-kit and services bundle that handled creating a uniform Login and Settings experience across our mobile apps. Eventually this app was converted to Flutter too.",

        "Getting to not only work with one of my biggest musical heroes but also having to advise against his will was a surreal experience I look back on fondly. Neil Young is a tough cookie but he was an understanding CEO if presented the information well. Despite the product not having much of a shelf life we still like to think we played somewhat of a role in Tidal, Apple Music and Spotify all upping the quality of their streamed content.",

        "I'm so proud that this product has withstood the test of time. We innovated so much on such a basic game and everyone on the team wore all the hats. The biggest highlight was probably leading the 'Multi-Table Tournament' project which allowed players to play in massive online tournaments with real world prizes. Server jumping, cross-server chat, economy syncing - so much cool stuff.",
